# Time Runner

A simple game made in Lua Language.

### First Idea

A game where you play as a mad scientist/time traveller guy, simple 2D game where your character is 
automatically running, you tap to jump over obstacles and swipe to knock down enemies. You start 
off each game popping out of a portal into a primordial forest, where you have to jump over things 
like marshes and tree stumps, with giant insects attacking you. If you survive this for long enough, 
the forest gradually begins to thin out, the ground becomes drier, and dinosaurs start appearing as 
enemies. The whole game will play like this, the longer you stay alive for the further forward you 
go in time. Simple graphics and repetitively-generated backgrounds will make it easy to produce 
plenty of different time periods, through ancient animals to primitive humans to ancient civilisation, 
through recorded history and culminating in the crumbling ruins of a high-tech space colony 
(having already run through the "living" version), which you'll keep running in forever if you get 
to that point. Finding new times give an incentive to progress, beyond the ordinary mechanic of 
highscores. Simple and addictive, but with an interesting unique selling point.
